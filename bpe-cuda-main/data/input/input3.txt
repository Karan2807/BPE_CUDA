So far the operations using the C program are done on a prompt/terminal that is not stored anywhere. But in the software industry, most of the programs are written to store the information fetched from the program. One such way is to store the fetched information in a file. Different operations that can be performed on a file are:  

Creation of a new file (fopen with attributes as “a” or “a+” or “w” or “w++”).
Opening an existing file (fopen).
Reading from file (fscanf or fgets).
Writing to a file (fprintf or fputs).
Moving to a specific location in a file (fseek, rewind).
Closing a file (fclose).
